- Andre set up the Android project codebase structure  
  - PR: https://github.com/AndreSlavescu/Team-Pluto-CS446-Project/pull/3
- Established that **each commit must be merged via a pull request**
- Planned our **[P3 proposal](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1nkpUWtLKtpFB6kV3QF-k3JekkKwRt9wvPuHHnuEV0o4/edit?usp=sharing)** and divided the write-up into **6 subsections**, one per team member

### Division of Work (P3 Proposal)
- **Andre Slavescu**  
  - Intro write-up (paragraphs answering the project topic and questions)

### Team Structure Planning
In our most recent meeting, we assigned higher-level roles to divide the team into **frontend** and **backend** subteams. We decided to:
- Start by building an **MVP**
- Define more detailed roles and features later as the project progresses
